## Introduction 
> JavaScript is the most widely deployed language in the world. Whether you’re interested in writing front-end client side code, back-end code for servers, or even game development, you’ll be able to accomplish all of this and more with JavaScript.


In simple words, we can say that with the help of JS, one can create fully functional __dynamic website__, __Games__ , desktop apps for __Windows/Linux/Mac__ and even cross platform native apps for __Android and iOS__.

## ECMAScript (ES)   
> ECMAScript (ES) is a scripting language specification standardized by ECMAScript International. It is used by applications to enable client-side scripting. Languages like JavaScript, Jscript and ActionScript are governed by this specification.    
__Note: If you are a newcomer then we recommed you to just get your hands on ES6 and thereafter you can start learning any new framework. ES7/ES8 = ES6 + few extra features.__

## How a Web App Works   
* __Intro__   
Web app is a client–server computer program which the client (including the user interface and client-side logic) runs in a web browser. Common web applications include webmail, online retail sales, online auctions, wikis, instant messaging services and many other functions. All the source code is hosted on server(A computer somewhere in this world or cloud like AWS/GCP/Azure etc) and any browser request it to access its content. We can classify website in two broad terms i.e, Static websites - whose content doesn't change like Portfolio Websites and Dynamic Websites - whose content keeps on changing like Facebook, Twitter etc.
